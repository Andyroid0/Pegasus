# Pegasus

Secure Freemium set of productivity tools.

## Getting Started

After you pull the Repo, bring the console to the directory containing all the program files. Running the command *python app.py* will launch the program.

Git Commands can be found at [Git-Commands cheatsheet](http://github.com/joshnh/Git-Commands).

If you don't want to use command line for GIT, there are GUIs available like [GITkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have an up-to-date version of python (3.7.6 I believe,) and Chrome. Python 3.8 doesn't work with some of the libraries that are required yet. I think that 3.8 is unstable anyway? So stick with 3.7.6


Libraries needed:
```
- eel
- tinydb
- pyautogui ( for automating some of the testing, not required but useful)
```

## Running the tests

Generally testing can be done with print() in python and console.log() in javascript. Everything else is hands on opening the GUI and trying to break it.

## Tool and Functionality Wish-list
```
- Screen-sharing, live white board, and web-audio conference tool. (turtle module might be useful)
- Video-Conferencing tool set.
- Forms creation tool. For use with surveys, exams, educational purposes, etc. 
- Wiki creation. ( documentation.)
- Word document processor. Super clean UI.
- Google Sheets/ Microsoft excel clone. Emphasis on simplicity of use.
- Use NOAA Api to create a new Dark Sky, in light of Apple acquiring it and locking out their api. [NOAA API docs](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#datasets)
```
