# Pegasus

Secure Freemium set of productivity tools.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have an up to date version of python (3.7.6 I believe.) 3.8 doesn't work with some of the libraries that are required yet. I think that 3.8 is unstable anyway? So stick with 3.7.6

Libraries needed:
```
- eel
- tinydb
- pyautogui ( for automating some of the testing, not required but useful)
```

## Running the tests

Generally testing can be done with print() in python and console.log() in javascript. Everything else is hands on opening the GUI and trying to break it.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
