# Pegasus

kanban/scrum board.

## Getting Started

After you pull the Repo, bring the console to the directory containing all the program files. Running the command *python app.py* will launch the program.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have an up-to-date version of python (3.7.6 I believe,) and Chrome. Python 3.8 doesn't work with some of the libraries at the time of writing this.


Libraries needed:
```
- eel
- tinydb
- pyautogui ( for automating some of the testing, not required but useful)
```

## Running the tests

Generally testing can be done with print() in python and console.log() in javascript.


## Built With

* [TinyDB](http://tinydb.readthedocs.io/) - The Database management system used.
* [Eel](https://github.com/samuelhwilliams/Eel) - Python library for creating Electron-like offline apps
* [Pyautogui](http://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) - Python library with automation tools for testing
